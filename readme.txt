Adds pseudo oembed support for PDF documents

== Description ==

Will embed a PDF file using Google Docs Viewer
Simply include the URL for a PDF document on it's own line, or wrapped in the embed tag like `[embed]http://example.com/file.pdf[/embed]` and the plugin will embed the PDF into the page using the Google Docs Viewer embed code.
The url must end with `.pdf`

== Installation ==

1. Upload 'dirtysuds-embed--pdf' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate **DirtySuds - Embed PDF** through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. That's it. Now when you embed a PDF using the Wordpress `[embed]` shortcode, the plugin will embed the document using the Google Docs viewer
